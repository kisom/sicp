## sicp

This is an attempt again at working through the Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs. Each chapter is presented as a
literate Scheme source file.

I use the [literate](https://github.com/kisom/literate/) tool to turn
these into an HTML notebook; this same process can be used to generate
PDF notebooks, as well.

The notebook is an in-progress work (as I work through the chapters);
however, th [online](http://files.kyleisom.net/sicp.html) version is
occasionally updated to keep up with progress.
