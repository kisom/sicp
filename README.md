This is an attempt again at working through the Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs. Each chapter is presented as a
literate Scheme source file.

I use the [literate](https://github.com/kisom/literate/) tool to turn
these into an HTML notebook; this same process can be used to generate
PDF notebooks, as well.
